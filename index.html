        <ul class="scrollPara" ; style="color: antiquewhite">
          <li>
            When opening this webpage for the first time, the instruction of the
            webpage pops up, forming a small tutorial that reveals the role and
            intention of the website, and the guidance is very clear.
          </li>
          <li>
            The website is filled with animations that simulate time changes.
            Whether it’s animation or tool menus, the colors are very soft and
            will not make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Meanwhile, a high
            saturation blue is used at the top of the information box, which can
            maximize the viewer's attention. The middle operation area is made
            with a circle slightly brighter than the background, which is more
            obvious when the background is darker, and it is a bit difficult to
            see when the background is brighter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity is used to make different contents of the same level into
            buttons of similar sizes, and then put them together, distinguish
            the contents of buttons with different colors. The fast forward key,
            reset and info buttons use grey color and smaller size to
            distinguish them from other contents below, which is clear and tidy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>mapping</h4>
        <p style="color: antiquewhite">
          Button is used as a medium for users to interact with the website.
          Button is a good hint that users can interact with the website through
          clicks. Users use drag and drop to add different elements to this
          ecosystem, but there is not much guidance after clicking the button,
          and users may be confused at this time. Perhaps changing the shape of
          cursor can guide the user more clearly.
        </p>
        <h4>characterisation</h4>
        <p style="color: antiquewhite">
          There are two water fleas under the guide box that pops up when the
          user opens the web page for the first time, showing the theme and
          characteristic of the website. The test uses pixel style to unify it
          with the style of the web page. The pixel style adds game features to
          the website, allowing the website to make users feel interested and
          curious. They might be more willing to explore the webpage. The
          website icon is a pixel aquarium, which also links to the content of
          the website.
        </p>
        <h4>feedback</h4>
        <p style="color: antiquewhite">
          When the user clicks the button, the button quickly changes color and
          its appearance changes from raised to concave, then remains, giving
          the user a hint that this button has been activated. This design
          clearly informs users that the button is activated. Meanwhile, some
          buttons, such as the information button, will instantly pop up when
          clicked, which distinguishes its function from that of other buttons.

        <h4>information</h4>
        <ul class="scrollPara" ; style="color: antiquewhite">
          <li>
            The rectangle in the same shape suggests 7 different poems, but the
            arrangement is scattered. The website's title uses a large font to
            capture the user's attention. The title of the poem is much smaller
            than the website title, showing their hierarchy.
          </li>
          <li>
            The website uses three simple colors to classify information, which
            is concise and clear. After the user clicks on the poem, showing the
            largest font of the webpage, which can capture the user's attention
            at once. However, this also affects the coherence of the text, and
            it is not easy for users to understand the entire poem. It is very
            interesting and creative to use music to capture users' attention,
            while giving visual and auditory stimulation to guide users to stay
            on the content of the website. At the same time, different music is
            used to distinguish different poetry, but there is proximity between
            the rhythms of the music, which not only distinguishes different
            poetry, but also indicates that they belong to the same level of the
            website. However, users will focus more on the integrated music and
            ignore text information. Use Whitespace to tell users where
            information is available, and it can also guide users to click. The
            website's texture and style are very unified and will not distract
            users.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>mapping</h4>
        <p style="color: antiquewhite">
          Using only color blocks to represent interactive content may cause
          confusion for users, who cannot immediately know that it can be
          clicked. However, after clicking and pause the music and poem, the
          color block turns into a button-like wireframe, which can clearly
          inform the user that this is a clickable item. The X-shaped pattern
          rotating at the lower right corner adopts an interaction method that
          can be triggered simply by placing cursor on it, reducing the
          difficulty of interaction. However, it’s hard to notice that this is
          an interactive item. The design of the Button does not clearly inform
          users that music will play after they click it.
        </p>
        <h4>characterisation</h4>
        <p style="color: antiquewhite">
          The website adopts flat design, using only color blocks, wireframes
          and a few shadows to build its style, which is simple and clear. The
          main components of the page are poetry and text. Therefore, a simple
          design will not distract users' attention and is pure enough. Bright
          colors and interactive content add personality and fun to the website.
          The addition of music enables users to "experience" poetry.
        </p>
        <h4>feedback</h4>
        <p style="color: antiquewhite">
          The fully flat design of the website makes the feedback of interaction
          not strong enough. Some interactive contents are based on clicking,
          while others are based on cursor placement with sliding out
          automatically. This is not uniform and can easily confuse users. At
          the same time, the feedback is further weakened - users cannot control
          whether the content on the right side slides out or nto. The music
          feedback is very creative and enhances the sense of feedback in the
          interaction.
