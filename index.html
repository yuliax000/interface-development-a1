        <h4>information</h4>

        <ol class="scrollPara">
          <li>
            When opening a web page for the first time, the information of the
            web page pops up, forming a small tutorial that reveals the role and
            intention of the website, and the guidance is very clear. The text
            introduction uses pixel style to unify it with the style of the web
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            The website is filled with animations that simulate time changes.
            Whether it’s animation or tool menus, the colors are very soft and
            will not make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Meanwhile, a high
            saturation blue is used at the top of the information box, which can
            maximize the viewer's attention. The middle operation area is made
            with a circle slightly brighter than the background, which is more
            obvious when the background is darker, and it is a bit difficult to
            see when the background is brighter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity is used to make different contents of the same level into
            buttons of similar sizes, and then put them closer together to
            distinguish the contents of buttons with different colors. However,
            the fast forward key, reset and info buttons only use colors to
            distinguish them from other contents below, which is not obvious
            enough and is easy to confuse.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>mapping</h4>
        <p>
          Button is used as a medium for users to interact with the website.
          Button can be a good hint that users can interact with the website
          through clicks. Users use drag and drop painting to add different
          elements to this ecosystem, but there is not much guidance after
          clicking the button, and users may be confused at this time. Perhaps
          changing the shape of cursor can guide the user more clearly.

        <h3>UI 2</h3>
        <nav>
          <a href="https://tdingsun.github.io/justine/">7 Poems</a>
        </nav>
        <h4>information</h4>
        <ol class="scrollPara">
          <li>
            The website uses two or three simple colors to classify information,
            which is concise and clear. After the user clicks on the poem, the
            font size is very large, which can capture the user's attention at
            once. However, this also affects the coherence of the text, and it
            is not easy for users to understand the entire poem.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is very interesting and creative to use music to capture users'
            attention, while giving visual and auditory stimulation to guide
            users to stay on the content of the website. At the same time,
            different music is used to distinguish different poetry, but there
            is proximity between the rhythms of the music, which not only
            distinguishes different poetry, but also indicates that they belong
            to the same level of the website. However, users will focus more on
            the integrated music and ignore text information.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>mapping</h4>
        <p>
          Only using color blocks to represent interactive content may cause
          confusion among users, users cannot know that they can click on it at
          the first time. However, after clicking on the color block and it’s
          paused, the color block becomes a button-like wireframe, which can
          clearly inform the user that this is a clickable item.
